# The Computable Protocol

This repository houses the Computable protocol, which seeks to build a decentralized data marketplace for intelligent agents.

## The Computable Contracts

The Vyper contracts, ABI and bytecode present here, are being actively developed in the [goest](https://github.com/computablelabs/goest) repo, which also contains our unit test suite. This repo contains stable versions of developed vyper contracts along with ABI and bytecode.

Once a version has been _frozen_, audited and deployed we will update this repo with said contracts and their deployment addresses.

### Language specific protocol support

Any (d)app created on top of the Computable Protocol may want to consider utilizing one of our "Higher-Order-Contract" libraries. Python
developers, for example, could use [Computable.py](https://github.com/computablelabs/computable.py).

## The Computable Book

To learn more about the Computable protocol, check out the [Computable book](https://computablelabs.github.io/compspec/) which provides a book-length introduction to the core Computable protocol.
