# The Computable Protocol

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/computablelabs/computable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/computablelabs/computable)

This repository implements the Computable protocol, which seeks to build a decentralized data marketplace for intelligent agents. The initial implementation of the Computable protocol is built as a set of interoperating solidity contracts on the Ethereum ecosystem.
It's important to emphasize that at present, this repo holds *alpha code*. We are hard at work on maturing our code and moving towards an initial launch, but at present this code comes with no guarantees of correctness.
We actively welcome bug reports, suggestions, and code contributions!

### Setup
* git clone...
* `npm install`
* `npm run truffle:compile`
* `npm run lint:solium`
